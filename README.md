NumberPlateDetectionUsingYOLO


Hello coders! If you are interested to use the pre-trained NumberPlateDetector you just need to download the model from my drive (link is in txt file) and use it!


If you are interested to train your own model then you can reffer to my colab file I have added the comments in colab file for better understanding.

You need to use your own dataset as due to some problem I can't share the dataset.
